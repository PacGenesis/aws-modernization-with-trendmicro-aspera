Today, businesses across industries are facing challenges moving large files and massive sets of data quickly, reliably, and securely between global sites and teams. As the size and volume of data continues to explode, the speed that data moves over becomes more crucial.

### AWS S3.

In March 2006, [Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) was launched and created as the first generally available AWS service, and since then, cloud data storage and usage has exploded, changing the world. . Amazon S3 has virtually unlimited scalability, and unmatched availability, durability, security, and performance. Customers of all sizes and industries can use Amazon S3 to store any amount of data for a range of use cases, such as data lakes, websites, mobile applications, backup and restore, archive, and big data analytics. Amazon S3 provides easy-to-use management features so you can organize your data and configure finely-tuned access controls to meet your specific business, organizational, and compliance requirements.

# Accelerating Secure Data Transfer

---


Cloud storage services like AWS S3 provide durability, availability, manageability, and a few security features. With the rapid rise in volume of data, file storage services like S3 are logical choices for modern business requirements.

Even with all the benifits of S3, migrating data can time consuming and potentially expose your data to security risks. Meeting complaince standards and enforcing best security practices is a layered approach between the customer, AWS and Trusted AWS Security Partners like Trend Micro. 

While the cloud service provider (CSP) is responsible for the infrastructure, you the customer are responsible for the configurations and what you store within it. That means it’s your duty to detect and remediate any misconfigurations or malware.

In this workshop, you will migrate data to AWS securely, using:
- AWS S3 to provide durable storage as well as some features like server-side encryption, versioning, IAM techniques. 
- IBM Aspera on Cloud™ to provide high-speed data transfers to migrate large amounts of data to S3.
- Trend Micro Cloud One™ File Storage Security to validate object for malware and maintain data sovereignty.
