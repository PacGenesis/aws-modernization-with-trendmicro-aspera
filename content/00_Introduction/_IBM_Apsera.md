### Aspera Technology

Aspera's Fast Adaptive Secure Protocol (FASP) is an innovative bulk data transport technology that is intended to provide an optimal alternative to traditional TCP-based transport technologies for transferring files over public and private IP networks. It is implemented at the application layer, as an endpoint application protocol, avoiding any changes to standard networking. FASP is designed to deliver 100 percent bandwidth efficient transport of bulk data over any IP network – independent of network delay and packet loss – providing the ultimate high-performance next-generation approach to moving bulk data.

FASP file transfers scale linearly, and provide a predictable transfer speed based on the available bandwidth of the sender and receiver:

### Aspera on Cloud

IBM Aspera on Cloud overcomes the data transfer challenges of the hybrid cloud by allowing companies to securely and reliably move big data across on-premises and multi-cloud environments at unrivaled speed. This hybrid service from IBM Aspera is the fastest way to transfer, exchange, and deliver data from any location to anywhere with anyone.

This service contains two distinct layers:
* <b>A web application</b> (hosted in IBM Cloud) that supports file transfer workflows thorugh a simple and clean end user experience.
* <b>A file transfer layer</b> that is truly hybrid; hosted in any plublic cloud, offered as a service, or self-managed by you (the client).

Through this unique hybrid architecture, users are able to access data stored on-premises or in the cloud through a simple user interface.  Directly send large files from your on-premises or cloud storage out to customers and partners, and invite them to upload data directly to your storage locations. Access to such transfer functionality and configured data stores are protected by a powerful access control model managed by service administrators. 

### Aspera on Cloud Workflows

The Aspera on Cloud offering is separated into four distinct applications: Files, Packages, Automation, and Activity.  Each are perfectly integrated to give you the tools to implement the workflows needed for your mission critical business processes.
* <b>Files</b> - Presents your data in a similar explorer like interface no matter the storage location or type.  The Files application is great for collaboration workflows as well as bulk data moves between storage locations either in the cloud or on-premises.  Files offers features like preview in the browser and the ability to create public and private links for each access.
* <b>Packages</b> - Email style file delivery workflow tool.  Packages is great for distribution workflows allowing for features like shared inboxes with fully customizeable sidecar metadata.  Packages provides a simple and intuitive interface allowing files and folders to be transferred seamlessly.
* <b>Automation</b> - A workflow design tool that anyone can use, offering triggers and actions available on a palate that can be dragged onto a canvas in order to chain together complex workflows.  Automation is perfect for building automated post-processes specific to your business needs.
* <b>Activity</b> - View all transfers in real-time and query historical transfer and application activity.  Activity offers a single pane of glass for all of your transfers, whether in the cloud or on-premises.
